### This is all still a pretty immature/experimental mess yet!

### Priorities:

* Since `.emacs.d` is _not_ a config dir, extra effort is needed to Keep my config 
 - self-containing, and 
 - separate from all the junk the various packages poop all over .emacs.d.

* Experimenting with Spacemacs etc. that take over the entire .emacs.d should
  be made (sort-of) easier by confining stuff into a subdir as much as possible.
